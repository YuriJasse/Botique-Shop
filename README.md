# Botique-Shop
A boutique is a small, specialized retail shop that offers a curated selection of unique and fashionable products, typically clothing, accessories, or jewelry. Unlike large department stores or mass retailers, boutiques focus on creating an exclusive shopping experience with personalized customer service.
